    foldr func carryValue lst

    In findFirst,
        func is findHelper
        carryvalue is  []
    and
        foldr is partially applied (lst to be supplied when findFirst is evaluated)

    foldr definition:

    foldr func carryValue lst =
        if null lst
        then carryValue
        else func (head lst) $ foldr func carryValue (tail lst)

    From the definition of foldr we can see that,

        foldr only evaluates maybeFound when the predicate is False. 
        When the predicate is True, it returns [listElement] immediately, 
        ignoring maybeFound.

        Note:   
        
        maybeFound 
        is equal to 
        foldr func carryValue (tail lst)
        
        This means the function doesnâ€™t need to process the entire list after finding a match.
